Welcome to my twitter sentiment analysis application.

I got my datasets from Kaggle: [Tweets About Top Companies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/tweets-about-the-top-companies-from-2015-to-2020?resource=download&select=Tweet.csv) and [Stock Values of Top Companies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/values-of-top-nasdaq-copanies-from-2010-to-2020?select=CompanyValues.csv).

This is a flask application. Simply run "flask run" in the terminal to run it.
