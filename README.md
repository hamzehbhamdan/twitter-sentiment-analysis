Welcome to my twitter sentiment analysis application.

I use four datasets for this project: company.csv, companyvalues.csv, tweet.csv, and company_tweet.csv. 

I got these from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/tweets-about-the-top-companies-from-2015-to-2020?resource=download&select=Tweet.csv and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/values-of-top-nasdaq-copanies-from-2010-to-2020?select=CompanyValues.csv

Two of my files, tweet.csv and company_tweet.csv cannot be put onto the repository as they are much larger than the 25mb limit.


This is a flask application. Simply run "flask run" in the terminal to run it.
